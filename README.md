🎵 Acoustic Wave Transfer Model
📌 Overview

The Acoustic Wave Transfer Model is a communication system that enables the transfer of images between devices using sound waves instead of the internet, Bluetooth, or physical cables. The project demonstrates how data can be converted into audio signals, transmitted via speakers, and reconstructed at the receiving end through microphones.

🚀 Features

Transfer images without internet, Bluetooth, or cables

Converts images into acoustic signals for transmission

Decodes received sound to reconstruct the original image

Demonstrates applications of signal processing in communication

Educational use for data encoding/decoding concepts

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

NumPy – numerical operations

SciPy – signal processing

Matplotlib – visualization

PyAudio – audio stream handling

Wave – audio file support

⚙️ How It Works

Encoding – Convert image into a binary stream, then map to acoustic signals.

Transmission – Play encoded sound via device speakers.

Reception – Capture sound using microphone.

Decoding – Reconstruct the binary stream and regenerate the image.
